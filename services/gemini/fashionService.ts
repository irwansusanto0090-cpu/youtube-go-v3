2.  **PRODUCT INTEGRATION:** The clothing product must be worn naturally by the model, conforming to their body shape with realistic folds, lighting, and shadows. The product's original details, color, and texture must be perfectly preserved.
3.  **PHOTOREALISM:** The final result must look like a professional studio photoshoot taken with a real camera (e.g., Canon EOS R5, 85mm lens, f/1.8), with realistic lighting and soft shadows.
4.  **BACKGROUND:** Create a simple, neutral studio background (like a light gray or off-white wall) that does not distract from the model and product.
5.  **ASPECT RATIO:** The final output image MUST be a 9:16 portrait.

This clip MUST be composed of 2-3 dynamic, smoothly-cut sub-scenes showcasing the model and the fashion in a sophisticated, cinematic style.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **Header:** The prompt MUST start with the exact phrase "NO TEXT, NO SUBTITLES, NO CAPTIONS, NO ON-SCREEN WORDS." on its own line, followed by a blank line.
2.  **Multi-Scene Structure:** The main body of the prompt must describe the 2-3 sub-scenes clearly.
3.  **Cinematic Language:** Use descriptive, professional cinematography terms (e.g., slow-motion, tracking shot, rack focus, extreme close-up, lens flare).
4.  **Content Focus:** The scenes should highlight the model's professional movements, the texture and flow of the clothing, and create an aspirational, elegant mood.
5.  **Likeness:** Emphasize that the model's face, body, and clothing from the original image must be maintained with 100% consistency.

**EXAMPLE FASHION PROMPT (MULTI-SCENE):**

NO TEXT, NO SUBTITLES, NO CAPTIONS, NO ON-SCREEN WORDS.

A hyperrealistic 8K cinematic video, 9:16 portrait aspect ratio, featuring a high-fashion model wearing a flowing silk dress. The scene is set in a minimalist architectural setting with dramatic shadows.

The 8-second video consists of three seamlessly integrated shots:

Scene 1 (3s): Slow-motion tracking shot. The model walks gracefully towards the camera with a confident expression, the fabric of her outfit flowing with the movement. The lighting is dramatic, casting soft shadows.

Scene 2 (2s): Extreme close-up. A rack focus shot that transitions from the texture of the garment's fabric to the model's serene face. A subtle, natural lens flare glints across the screen.

Scene 3 (3s): Medium shot. The model strikes the exact pose from the reference image, holding it for a moment before turning and walking away as the scene fades.

Cinematography Details:
Lighting: Dramatic, high-contrast, directional soft light.
Mood: Elegant, powerful, sophisticated, aspirational.
Camera movements: Smooth tracking shots, slow push-ins, rack focus.
Composition: Rule of thirds, shallow depth of field (f/1.4).
Audio: Ambient, minimalist electronic music with a strong, slow beat.

Negative prompt: avoid unnatural motion, distorted faces, robotic movements, cartoonish visuals, text overlays, outfit inconsistencies.

1.  **EXECUTE THE EDIT:** You MUST apply the change described in the "User's Instruction". The output image should be visibly different from the input image, reflecting the requested edit. This is the highest priority.
2.  **MAINTAIN REALISM:** The edit must be photorealistic and seamlessly integrated. The final image must look like a real, unedited photograph.
3.  **PRESERVE IDENTITY:** If a person is in the image, their identity (face, body, etc.) must remain 100% the same. Do not change the person unless specifically asked to.
4.  **ISOLATE THE CHANGE:** Only change what is requested in the instruction. Preserve all other aspects of the image (e.g., background, lighting, composition) unless the instruction requires them to be changed.
5.  **CLEAN OUTPUT:** The final image must be clean. No text, logos, watermarks, or any other artifacts.
